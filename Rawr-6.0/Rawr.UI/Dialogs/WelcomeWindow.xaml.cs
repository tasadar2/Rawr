FAQStuff.Add(
"Where can I set the Stat Weights in Rawr?",
@"Rawr absolutely, flat out, completely, in no way uses Stat Weights (the idea of assigning a Stat a value and using that to score gear, Eg- STR = 1.2 so an item with 20 STR would be value 24). Instead, each Stat is calculated into a modeling process that includes all of the class' abilities with respect to the character as a whole. The gear comparison then becomes the total character change that item would provide. DPS classes see DPS changes, Tanks see Survivability changes, and Healers see HPS changes. This is what sets Rawr apart from most other modeling programs."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why isn't the Optimizer keeping my meta gem active?",
@"You need to set Enforce Gem Requirements to be enabled. See Gemmings for more details."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Enforce Gem Requirements is active, so why isn't Rawr forcing the gems to match the socket colors?",
@"Enforce Gem Requirements only does two things: ensure that the meta gem is activated, and ensure that any Unique or Unique-Equipped gems are, in fact, unique. The gemmings recommended may or may not match the socket bonuses, irregardless of this option's state. Rawr does not have any options to set to force socket bonuses to be activated, and instead recommends the best gemming possible, whether it's with the socket bonus, or ignoring it. See Gemmings for more details."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why does the Optimizer try and equip two of my weapon when I only have one?",
@"The item is not Unique, so the Optimizer assumes that you simply have access to the item, as it does not know how many of a given item you have. To restrict the Optimizer to consider only one copy of a weapon, right-click the item, select Edit, and mark the item as Unique. This will prevent the Optimizer from putting the item in both MH and OH slots, as if you had two copies of the item. The same process can be used for rings and trinkets."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why does a Troll's Berserking and an Orc's Bloodfury not show up in the Buffs list?",
@"Racial buffs are automatically added to the character stats, based on your race selection in the Character Definition area of the Stats pane."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why does the Optimizer sometimes lower my DPS?",
@"The Optimizer operates on a Random Seed method, which is why it works at all. Sometimes it can't use that random seed to find a set that is better than what you are currently wearing. This is a known issue that we wish to hopefully find a solution for in the future. In the meantime, you can help the Optimizer to find the optimal setup by following these steps:
- Limit the number of potential items that you mark as available to the Optimizer. As the number of pieces of gear / gems / enchants rise, the number of potential solutions (results) the Optimizer can create increases exponentially. Periodically clean up your list of items that you know will perform as well as other options.
- Increase the Optimizer thoroughness by moving the slider on the Optimizer window to the right. While the Optimizer will take longer to run, it will be checking through more and more potential setups the higher the thoroughness is set.
- Make absolutely sure that everything on your current character is marked as available to the Optimizer. This includes gear, enchants, and gems. This should be mostly covered by a check that is run when you start the Optimizer, though we are currently refining the warning dialogue to be more descriptive (to tell you exactly what you are currently wearing is not available to the Optimizer)."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why does the Optimizer sometimes just rearrange my Gems?",
@"In the more modern versions of Rawr, this issue should no longer exist."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why is my Crit value so low, compared to the in-game character panel?",
@"Boss level relative to your own affects your actual chance to deal a critical strike. Targets that are three levels higher than your own (83, or Boss level) exhibit a 4.8 crit depression / conversion, which affects both white and yellow damage. Rawr calculates and displays your actual chance to crit, while the in-game character panel reflects your stats against a same-level target."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why does X talent/glyph not show any value in the comparison lists?",
@"Many talents cannot be valued by DPS gain or by Survivability Gain. It's also possible that you do not have the Situation setting where the Talent/Glyph would have value. For example, If you are never Stunned, then a Warrior's Iron Will wouldn't have a value."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why is it when I run the Optimizer I don't end up hit and/or expertise capped?",
@"The optimizer, when run without any requirements, will attempt to find the highest possible total DPS. In many cases, this does not include being hit/expertise capped, either by a small amount, or sometimes even by a larger amount. This is usually a correct recommendation in terms of optimizing you DPS / tanking performance. However, sometimes one may need to ensure that an interrupt or a Taunt does not miss. To ensure that an avoidance cap is enforced, add the '% Chance to be Missed <= 0' requirement before optimizing. Similar parameters are available (model-dependent) for Dodged, Parried, and Avoided, the latter taking into account all types of target avoidance."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why do higher tier items sometimes show less value than lower tier items?",
@"Set Bonuses can have a serious impact on DPS; getting that 2nd or 4th piece can mean more or less for your character in specific gear-sets. It could impact your meta gem requirements, depending on your setup."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why aren't items with Resilience considered relevant?",
@"Rawr is for PvE, not PvP. Modeling for PvP settings is an exercise in futility, due to the wide range of fight settings, high mobility, the extreme variability of damage intake and damage output requirements, and the sheer number of potential targets that are presented in PvP situations. Some models allow for comparison of PvP-sourced items, despite the wasted item budget, and some filter out those items with Resilience. Check the Options panel for your particular model for more information."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why are the stats wrong for my X level (sub-80) character when I load from Armory?",
@"Rawr is for end-game PvE, meaning you should be level 80. Rawr does not factor things for leveling as there is no point, you will replace the item in a couple of levels anyway and all your raiding gear will end up requiring level 80 to wear."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why can't I select X weapon type?",
@"Some weapon types are pointless to factor in depending on your model. For example, Fury Warriors and Enhance Shaman will never use staves, and Arms Warriors will never use one-handed weapons. Rawr intentionally does not consider such futile, sub-optimal situations."
);

FAQStuff.Add(
"Why can't I select X armor type?",
@"Each model typically only shows those items that are specifically designed for use with a certain class, but limiting the armor shown to that of the highest armor class that is wearable. However, there are certainly a number of situations in which downarmoring provides similar, only slightly lower, or sometimes even better performance for a given character. Some examples might be a Hunter considering Leather armor, or a Resto Shaman considering Cloth. To enable such considerations, simply pull up Tools > Refine Types of Items Listed, and enable / disable what items you would like to consider as applicable."

- Fury's Precision now properly applies the 40% Bonnus White damage
- Removed some dead code
- Updated the Rage from Incoming Damage calculations to iterate through boss attacks using damage and uptime values. Still using the Cataclysm modifier of 2.5/453.3 though, need to determine the new modifier.

- PTR changes:

* Add 30% damage buff to Wild Mushroom calculations
* Also changed the Wild Mushroom calculations to 650-786 base damage per mushroom, rather than split across all 3 mushrooms. I have no idea if this is correct
- Switch the Wild Mushroom calculations to match the spreadsheet:
* Reduce coefficient to the spreadsheet value. (Needs confirmation)
* Re-reduce damage to 650-786 across all 3 mushroom
- DEFAULT_GEMMING_TIER changed to 1 - Array was zero based not 1 based so default of 2 was epic instead of rare. Epic gems of course don't exist yet in Cataclysm.

Rawr.Base:
- Added Item Set Comparisons!!! You can now use the Tools Menu to Add/Equip/Remove Saved Sets for comparison.
- Addon Importing now filters out items from your bags/bank that aren't relevant to the model. So if you have tank gear in your bags and you are wearing your healing gear, the model loads into the healing model and doesn't mark the tank gear available (as well as junk gear link Green Winter Hat)
- You can now save an Optimized GearSet to the ItemSets list. This does not save changes in the optimizer other than the items themselves (meaning no buff or talent changes)
- Started work on adding parsings for Cata trinkets. Currently have most 'On Use' effects in place.
- Cleaned up the 'On Use' special effects section so that procs are grouped up and duplicate lookups are removed.

- Fixed Character class wasn't copying CogwheelId & HydraulicId from gemming templates therefore wasn't using them at all
- Add a spell crit depression array. The only values I'm 100% sure of are Level+0 and Level+3 - the other two are just guesstimates. Could use some testing.

- Save to addon implemented now exports data of equipped items to Addon from Rawr
- Fixed some level 83 references that should be 88 now across several models

- Added an option for people with low res monitors to hide the shirt & tabard icons and move the gloves to the left side, basically saves you a row of paper doll selectors

- Removed the usage of LocationFactory as a separate cache, there is now no need for ItemSource.xml
- Resorted the Wowhead.cs file so its easier to find stuff (had gotten rather haphazard)
- Working on getting Update Item Cache from Wowhead working. Initial code placed but throws constant InvalidCrossThreadAccess errors
- Moved several import/export dialogs to a new Character folder (instead of cluttering up the Dialogs folder)
- Polished up the Item Editor some more with Group Boxes
- Added Binds On selector to the Item Editor
- Added the ability to Compare an Item Set to your currently equipped items using the Optimizer Results window. You can also equip the comparing set from that window.
- The tooltips on the Item Sets chart entries now display as an Item List (like the bottom of the Build Upgrade List's tooltips) instead of a giant wall of text.
- Fix for Issue 19411: Error pop up on sorting and changing charts - Needed the special sort check in the new chart switch sorting
- Task 19069 Work: Add support for Engineering tinkers

Rawr.BossHandler:
- Raid Boss armour confirmed at 11977 not 10643
- Issue 19328 Work: GetDPSbyType always uses avoidance stats - Added some if statements into the calc that would be for formulating against other attack types. They are non-functional at this time, just a placeholde

Rawr.ItemFilters:
- Vendor Item Source now supports multiple tokens, the second one can be typed in.
- Slight adjustments to the Rare mobs listing
- Ensured the ItemFilters were fixed and in the DefaultDataFiles.zip

Rawr.Items:
- Change Darkmoon Card: Volcano to use two different special effects for the two different parts of the proc.

- A bunch of the Source parsing from Wowhead is now fixed. Still more work to do
- Parsing source from Wowhead is about 95% functional now. Only a few items won't get source data (not counting the ones that simply don't have source data on wowhead yet).

- - Now sets both the purchase currency+cost and where the currency drops (namely the armor token drops) if its available

- Improvements to Vengeance calculations

Rawr.DPSWarr:
- Overhauled using warnings from Code Analysis
- Fix for Issue 19372: SMT with 1H Weapons doesn't work
- - This was Three separate things
- - You need to go to Filters by Item Type and turn on 1h Weapons then click Apply. DPSWarr by default doesn't show them but does leave you the option to turn them on
- - SMT wasn't handled correctly. I've fixed this
- - Having a non-1h in the OffHand is throwing a NaN on that chart, so it ends up not knowing what to do and crashes. Added a handler to check for NaN in that core file so no models can make that break anymore.
- Modelled BonusWhiteDamageMultiplier (some new trinkets use this)
- More overhauling
- Fixed a bug that would make all the Buff Selectors disappear

- Fix a display issue where the hit cap is not displayed properly for non-raid boss targets
- Got the numbers backwards on the display function

- Version 0.08
- - Removed Equipped Block for equipped items in export
- - Removed alternate talent lists for other classes
- - Fixed extra line break at start of file
- - Added extra indent for available items for visual inspection
- - Refactor slot working
- - Dry coded blacksmithing socket check
- - Has sockets returns true for time being
- Version 0.09
- - Fixed some parsing issues to make it work
- - Export Class name as lowercase
- - Flag as v0.09 in TOC
- - Updated version check for Rawr AddOn to 0.09 and added version notes to the LUA
- - Added RawrBuild tag to export to allow Rawr to know what minimum build addon supports.

Rawr.Base:
- Created Import from Rawr AddOn process in program!
- - only Imports what you are wearing
- - Doesn't mark as available to the optimizer yet
- - Gems in sockets didn't work on test toon, need to investigate
- Fix for Issue 19269:  Enchant Cloak - Protection should give bonus armor - Changed to Bonus Armor
- Hid Add/Delete Custom Gemming menu options as they are non-functional and will be removed from program
- Changed ErrorBox to use a Silverlight ErrorWindow method instead of MessageBox so that we can keep it more internal and give a better window
- Armory Imports that fail with a not Found will state better messaging
- Enable Enchant Off-Hand - Superior Intellect.
- Potential fix for no saved file.
- Fix for bad merge.
- Fix for optimization without any available cogwheel/hydraulic.
- For the most part you should now be able to manually set sources for items. Please report bugs in the Issue Tracker on this.
- Fixed null checks
- More work for Item Sourcing, can now properly store and recall up to three sources per item and they show all of them on the Item Tooltips and should all be filterable against. If any one source is available from current filters it should show. Turn off all filters related to the sources to hide it.
- ilevel box on the Edit Item dialog was persisting between items. Changed handling so that it won't
- Same thing for Min/Max Weapon damage
- Added parsing for a trinket
- ItemFilters had a couple || in it, so those filters were matching everything and you couldn't properly hide a lot of items
- Fixed some bugs with Item Source editing
- More ItemSource fixes
- Fix for issue 19301: Copy Data to Clipboard on the Direct Upgrades->Gear chart only copies head-slot items - the list that Copy to Clipboard uses was only being Updated on item charts. Added checks to every chart type so they will all Export
- Fix for Issue 19292: Export to CSV generates FileSecurityState_OperationNotPermitted error - Tested that this cannot be performed in browser. When Installed Offline you can. Set a check to see if you were running Offline and if not will alert User that they need to install Offline before they can do this.
- Fix for Issue 19287: Editing/importing items seems to add them to the cache, but are unavailable to equip. or optimizer - I think a large part of this issue is users not switching to the right model or race beforehand so the Items are filtered out as irrelevant - Added a check to ensure the item shows in the chart if it is Relevant
- Fix for Issue 18697: Pawn export doesn't consider value of weapon DPS - Added Pawn Export function from Rawr2 - Added check for melee classes to add MeleeDPS1 to the string so that it gets a value
- Updated a few shaman races base stats
- New Rawr4 Welcome Window with a lot more noob friendliness
- More Welcome Window stuff
- Additional support for model based reforging restrictions
- Redid the Welcome Window some to give the Tabs more room (so you can read them more easily)
- Populated the Version History with Rawr4 stuff instead of Rawr2 from Nov 2009
- Fixed the Tips display
- Populated the Known Issues list with Open Issues that haven't already been resolved for .11
- Fixed the annoying scrollbar for no reason issue on the main page
- Fixed Windwalk's Enchant Id
- GetCritReductionFromResilience now always returns 0. Resilience has not reduced crit strike chance since 4.0.1
- Moved crit chance reduction via resilence removal to the right spot. I didn't realize at first that GetCritReductionFromResilience still calculates crit damage reduction.
- More ItemSource fixes
- Performance fixes

Rawr.Bear:
- Fix for Issue 19244: Ignoring Threat Rating Customization - Added ThreatScale to the ThreatPoints value

Rawr.DK:
- Fix for Defect 19241: Items not showing on list - This was due to bad gemming templates. So I shamelessly stole the template format from DPSWarr. It works great!
- Fix for possible rotation exception Found during new unit test.
- Fix for sorting issue in sorting by DPS/TPS
- Fix for BB weirdness.
- Fix bug w/ exception in rotation cost evaluation. Found during unittest.
- Fixed Tanking runes
- Fixed special effects handler
- Fixed Blood Parasite implementation
- Implemented basic RPP5 code
- Implemented combinedswing time for DW.
- Implemented Mitigation Subvalues like the survival subvalues.
- Fix for 19288: Hang when looking at trinkets.
- Unittests failing because of a config change.

Rawr.DPSWarr:
- Heroic Throw can no longer go nuts and take over your rotation
- Random work on stuff
- Worked on Heroic Strike/Cleave and how it interacts with the rotation. I'm liking the numbers I'm seeing and Rage is a lot smoother in interaction. This also greatly boosted Haste's relative value and it's not spikey in the test files like it was before.
- Changed the weighting of Normal v Exec phase so that they are based on percentage of time instead of direct average.

Rawr.Elemental:
- Activated the Gemming Templates so Items would show up
- Fixed a Null bug with Frost Shock
- It comes up without crashing now

Rawr.HealPriest:
- Fix for Issue 19280: Model not loading - Uncommented the RegisterModel command, now it loads

Rawr.Mage:
- Support for mastery procs (arcane only for now, probably slightly overestimates).
- Partial support for int procs (includes int=> spell power conversion, regen from max mana and negative impact on mana adept, does not include int=>crit conversion at the moment)
- Fix for int procs.
- Added Draenei hit bonus.

Rawr4.Moonkin:
* Fix double-counting base Druid crit.
* Fix for defect #19282: Items, talents, etc., have no value when no character is loaded.
- Fix for Issue 19317: SpellPower and Hit slightly off - User reported that base Intellect and Spirit don't factor into SpellPower and Hit fully. Implemented suggested fix
- Fix for issue where reforging was showing nonsensical combinations
- Add Intellect and Mastery trinket procs

Rawr.ProtPaladin:
- Fix for Issue 19281: Items not loading - No Gemming Templates were enabled by default (due to there being no Epic Templates this early in Cataclysm). Set Rare templates to enable instead of Epic
- Fixed crit vulnerability calculations
- Fixed display issue when crit immune
- Updated consecration probability calculations
- Added Mastery Rating to the item budget table
- Added custom rotation, fixed some miscellaneous bugs, started work on fixing the scales
- Bar colors now match other tank models 

Rawr.RestoSham:
- New gemming templates created and working, default set to use rares
- Fixed a parenthesis error

Rawr.ShadowPriest:
- Fix for Issue 19320: Mastery Rating doesn't show up for ShadowPriest Items - Added Mastery Rating as a Relevant Stat, though it will have no value

Rawr.TankDK:
- Fix for Runetap
- Fix for Mitigation values being Sky high - I was double adding the TotalDPS to PhysicalDPS from boss.
- Some other massaging

Rawr.Addon:
- Fixed drycoding errors

Rawr4.Base:
- Hid the Force Refresh box as we don't have caching on the server yet. 
- Fix for Issue 19240 - Tooltips for Cloaks were not showing their Additional Info strings (iLvl, Id, etc). - Cloaks used to be considered ItemType.Cloth but now they are ItemType.None. Needed to add a check to ensure the slot was still Back like we do for Necks, Rings and Trinkets
- Updated the Welcome Window with newer/better info and forced it to show always until we make a couple releases from this one.
- Fixed a null reference bug with Icons 

Rawr.Base.Items:
- Updated source information for all Reputation and Crafted Gear
- Added any Reputation/Crafted gear that were not in before
- Added Guild Reputation Heirloom heads and backs 
- Changed default on Enter ID form to Use Wowhead 
- Loading from BNet Armory now checks wowhead for items that are not in the database. This will be VERY slow when it occurs for a couple minutes, but then it will clear up when its done and when you close out those items are saved so you won't have to get them again.
- Removed the proxying process for communicating with wowhead. This should fix wowhead item loading for a lot of people 

Rawr.Mage:
- Make sure spell cost reduction can't make base spell cost negative."
