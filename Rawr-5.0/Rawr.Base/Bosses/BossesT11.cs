             * "Valiona, the purple dragon"
             * On the ground:
             * Melee - Hits for relatively weak physical damage on the tank, ranging from 15k-25k(10m)/17k-30k(25m), but more healing is needed for the raid damage from the other fight mechanics.
             * 
             * [Heroic] Twilight Shift - A heroic only ability used approximately every 20 seconds. It applies a debuff on the current highest threat target that stacks up to 5 times and has a 100
             *      second duration. At 5 stacks it will cause Shifting Reality which causes 35k shadow damage to all players within 8 yards and causes them to shift into the Twilight Realm.
             *      Additionally, you will deal (10%???) increased damage while in the Twilight Realm.
             *    
             * Blackout (10) / (25) - This is cast by Valiona on a random raid member at which point it can be removed by absorbing 20k(10m)/50k(25m) healing or by lasting the 15 second duration.
             *      It can also be dispelled on non-heroic. When it expires, it deals 350k(10m)/850k(25m) [Heroic: 400k(10m)/1.3mil(25m)] shadow damage split between everyone within (10-20???) yards.
             *      Tenative cd is 45 seconds. It cancels while in the air.
             * 
             * Devouring Flames (10) / (25) - Valiona will turn toward a random raid member and start this 2.5 second cast during which players in the way can attempt to run out of the way.
             *      Then for 5 seconds all player in front of Valiona will take 50k(10m)/80k(25m) [Heroic: 110k(10m)/(25m)] shadow damage per second, however, this damage can be lessened by being
             *      further away from the dragon.
             *      
             * In the air:
             * Twilight Meteorite (10) / (25) - This is cast by Valiona on a random raid member, marking them with an arrow. After 6 seconds, that player will take 150k(10m)/300k(25m)
             *      [Heroic: 190k(10m)/360k(25m)] shadow damage split between everyone within (10???) yards.
             * 
             * Deep Breath - Aerial special casted 3 times before descending from the air. Valiona travels to either the far east or west of the room and breathes Twilight Flames (10) / (25)
             *      along the ground straight across, dealing 15k(10m)/(25m) [Heroic: 25k(10m)/30k(25m)] shadow damage and sending anyone in them path into the Twilight Realm. The horizontal trail
             *      of Twilight Flames (10) / (25) remain on the ground and deals 6.5k(10m)/8.5k(25m) additional shadow damage every second to nearby players. This ability will cover a third of the
             *      room, either the north, south, or center (similar to Felmyst's ability in Sunwell Plateau).
             *      
             * "Theralion, the blue dragon"
             * On the ground:
             * Melee - Hits for relatively weak physical damage on the tank, ranging from 15k-25k(10m)/17k-30k(25m), but more healing is needed for the raid damage from the other fight mechanics.
             * [Heroic]Twilight Shift - A heroic only ability used approximately every 20 seconds. It applies a debuff on the current highest threat target that stacks up to 5 times and has a

             *      
             * Fabulous Flames (10) / (25) - This is cast by Theralion on a random raid member. Everyone within 15 yards will take 15.5k(10m)/25k(25m) shadow damage and then a Fabulous Flames
             *      patch (10) / (25) will spawn dealing an additional 15k(10)/(25m) [Heroic: 19k(10m)/(25m)] shadow damage per second to players still in it. These despawn after 45 seconds and
             *      are cast at 15 second intervals.
             *      
             * Engulfing Magic - This 20 second duration debuff is used on a random raid member [Heroic: 2 raid members] which increases the player's damage and healing by 100%, but deals damage
             *      to all friendly players within (8-10???) yards equivalent to the amount of healing or damage done. This damage does not harm the player debuffed with Engulfing Magic.
             *      Tenative cd is 37 seconds.It cancels while in the air.
             *      
             * In the air:
             * Twilight Blast (10) / (25) - Every 3.2 [Heroic: 2.0] seconds, one of these bombs are launched on a random raid member, dealing 30k(10m)/40k(25m) damage to all players within (6-8???) yards.
             * 
             * Dazzling Destruction (10) / (25) - Aerial special cast 3 times before descending from the air. Theralion will mark 3 swirling vortex locations and after 4 second, those spots will be bombed,
             *      dealing 15k(10m)/25k(25m) shadow damage to anyone within (12-15???) yards and sending them into the Twilight Realm.
             *      
             * "Twilight Realm"
             * Twilight Zone - All players inside of the Twilight Realm receive a stacking debuff every 2 seconds that deals 5k [Heroic: 7.5k] shadow damage and increases shadow damage taken by
             *      10% until clicking a portal near the perimeter of the room that causes the player to Leave Twilight Realm.
             *      
             * Unstable Twilight (10) / (25) - Floating spheres of unstable twilight energy exist in the Twilight Realm spread out approximately 10 yards from each other. Any player that touches an orb
             *      will cause it to explodes, dealing 40k [Heroic: 55k] shadow damage to all players within (8-10???) yards.
             *      
             * Dazzling Destruction - Players hit by this ability when already in the Twilight Realm will take 500k [Heroic: 750k] shadow damage.
             * 
             * Twilight Flames (10) / (25) - Players hit by the direct attack of this ability when already in the Twilight Realm will take 500k [Heroic: 750k] shadow damage.
             * 
             * Twilight Sentry - Several of these dragonkin NPCs exists in the Twilight Realm and each has ???k(10m)/???(25m) [Heroic: 309k(10m)/???k(25m)] health.
             *      On heroic mode, they will channel [Heroic]Twilight Rifts that exist in the normal realm. They use [Heroic]Rift Blast (10) / (25) attacks in the normal realm to shoot projectiles
             *      every 3 seconds that deal 10k(10m)/15k(25m) shadow damage to a random player.

             * Hurricane (10) / (25) - This is Rohash's full energy special attack. Used when at 90 energy, this spell is channeled for 15 seconds,
             *      during which, Rohash will lift anyone on his platform into the air and deal 2500(10m)/5000(25m)/3500(10h)/7500(25h) nature damage per second to them,
             *      and then drop them from the air, dealing fall damage.
             *      
             * Deafening Winds (10) / (25) - Rohash's penalty ability, used if no one is on his platform for over 1 second. This debuff aura will be
             *      applied to everyone in the raid and will silence and deal increasing nature damage, starting at 500(10m)/2000(25m).
             *      
             * "Anshal, Djinn of the West Wind"
             * Melee - 13k-22k(10m) / 22k-34k(25m) after mitigation at an average swing speed.
             * 
             * Soothing Breeze (10) / (25) - Places a green circle under Anshall with a 10 yard radius that lasts for 30 seconds. Raid members are
             *      silenced and unable to attack with physical attacks while in the circle, and Anshal and any adds that are within the aura are healed
             *      for 20000(10m)/40000(25m)/80000(25h) per second.
             *      
             * Nurture - 5 second channeled spell that summoned a seed every second. Shortly after these seeds spawn into Ravenous Creepers (Plant
             *      Lashers), which each melee for 4-7k(10m)/6k-9k(25m) after mitigaton. They also use an AoE attack in melee, Toxic Spores (10) / (25),
             *      and this attack can quickly stack to it's maximum of 25 stacks on everyone within melee range of the Ravenous Creepers at which
             *      point it will do significant damage. The debuff only has a 5 second duration, unless refreshed, but deals 500(10m)/1000(25m)/5000(25h) nature
             *      damage per stack every second.
             *      
             * Zephyr (10) / (25) - This is Anshal's full energy special attack. Used when at 90 energy, this spell is channeled for 15 seconds, during
             *      which, Anshal heals himself and any other adds left up on his platform for 25000(10m)/50000(25m)/100000(25h) per second, which equates to a total of
             *      375k(10m)/750k(25)/1,500k(25h) health, and they all get a stacking 15% damage buff which will then last for 15 seconds after the channel has ended,
             *      during which Anshal will have a total of 225% increased damage.
             *      
             * Withering Winds (10) / (25) - Anshal's penalty ability, used if no one is on his platform for over 1 second. This debuff aura will be applied
             *      to everyone in the raid and will reduce all healing received by 100% and deal increasing shadow damage, starting at 500(10m)/2000(25m).

             * "Fair Weather Phase"
             * Melee - Al'Akir's physical damage is moderate and pretty consistant with hits ranging from 20k-30k(10m)/40k-55k(25m) after mitigation.
             * 
             * Electrocute - This ability is used on the highest player on Al'Akir's threat table if that player is not in melee range. It is channeled
             *      and deals increasing nature damage over time. This may happen from knock backs via Wind Bursts in P1 or due to having to run for the
             *      opening in the Squall Line in P2.
             *      
             * Static Shock - A debuff placed on all players within (5-8???) yards of Al'Akir used approximately every 15 seconds. This debuff will then
             *      deal 1k nature damage and interrupt any spell being cast at every 1 second interval for 5 seconds.
             *      
             * Ice Storm - A slow moving cloud travels along Al'Akir's platform roughty 15 yards away from him just outside of his melee range. The falling
             *      Ice Storm deals 7500(10m)/15000(25m) frost damage per second and leaves a 50% movement speed reduction debuff on any player that get within 5 yards of
             *      it's current location or the path of ice it leaves behind.
             *      
             * Wind Burst - This 5 second cast time spell happens after an emote and deals 28275 to 31725(10m)/38000 to 42000(25m)/42412 to 47587(10h)/57000 to 63000(25h)
             *      nature damage and causes a 15 yard knock back to everyone in the room. It can knock off ranged DPS near the outer edge of Al'Akir's platform.
             *      
             * Lightning Strike - This ability is only used in the first phase and deals 9500 to 10500(10m)/19000 to 21000(25m) nature damage in a wide cone
             *      towards a random player, making it beneficial to not have the entire raid stacked in the same location.
             *      (*Note: This was working in some attempts, not sure if it is still in the encounter or being reworked)
             *      
             * "Bad Weather Phase"
             * Melee - Al'Akir's physical damage is moderate and pretty consistant with hits ranging from 20k-30k(10m)/40k-55k(25m) after mitigation.
             * 
             * Electrocute - This ability is used on the highest player on Al'Akir's threat table if that player is not in melee range. It is channeled and
             *      deals increasing nature damage over time. This may happen from knock backs via Wind Bursts in P1 or due to having to run for the opening
             *      in the Squall Line in P2.
             *      
             * Static Shock - A debuff placed on all players within (5-8???) yards of Al'Akir used approximately every 15 seconds. This debuff will then deal
             *      1k nature damage and interrupt any spell being cast at every 1 second interval for 5 seconds.
             *      
             * Squall Line (10) / (25) - Several tornadoes form a line radiating our from the inner to the outer edge of Al'Akir's platform. This wall will
             *      only have one open gap (similar to Sartharion's Flame Wall ability) which will allow players to not be hit by the Squall Line as it passes
             *      clockwise or counterclockwise along the platform. Getting hit will cause 10000(10m)/20000(25m)/40000(25h) nature damage and temporary loss
             *      of control while stunned.
             *      (*Note: In addition to the large obvious gap in the Squall Line, ranged DPS and healers that are standing on the very furthest points of the 
             *      platforrm's outside edge will also avoid the damage.)
             *      
             * Acid Rain - This debuff has a 17 second duriation, allowing it just enough time to keep refreshing and stacking every 20 seconds on every raid
             *      member for all of the second phase of the encounter. Each stack will deal 500(10m)/750(25m) nature damage per second.
             *      
             * Stormling - Al'Akir summons a Stormling lightning elemental that has 258k(10m)/901866(25m) health which melee for 2.5k(10m)/4000 to 4500(25m) physical damage
             *      as well as constantly pulse Stormling (10) / (25) which deals an additional 2375 to 2625(10m)/4750 to 5250(25m) nature damage players within (6???) yards.
             *      (heroic also 25% nature damage debuff)
             *      
             * Feedback - Whenever a Stormling dies, they will grant Al'Ashkir one stack of this debuff which increases his damage taken by 10% for 20 seconds.
             * 
             * "Electric Storm Phase"
             * Eye of the Storm - This buff is placed on all raid members in final phase of the fight. It grants flight and increases movement speed by 300%,
             *      however, removes the ability block, dodge, or parry.
             *      
             * Relentless Storm - Any player that is too far from Al'Akir will be temporarily stunned for 10 seconds as they are tossed around and launched back
             *      closer into the room.
             *      
             * Wind Burst - In the last phase, this ability no longer has a cast time and instead is much more dangerous being instant, dealing 50k nature damage,
             *      and causing a 10 yard knock back.
             *      
             * Chain Lightning - This is used very often by Al'Akir in the last phase, roughly every 2 seconds. It deals 14250 to 15750(10m)/28500 to 31500(25m)/20900 to
             *      23100(10h)/42750 to 47250(25h) nature damage to a random target and then jumping to new targets that are within (6-8???) yards, with each jump increasing
             *      the damage dealt by 30%.
             *      
             * Lightning Rod (10) / (25) - This ability is placed on 1 player at a time the last phase. A player will get this debuff and then, 5 seconds later,
             *      will begin to pulse and AoE for 5 seconds that deal 4750 to 5250(10m)/9500 to 10500(25m)/7125 to 7875(10h)/14250 to 15750(25h) nature damage every
             *      second to all players within 20 yards horizontally, and/or 5 yards vertically.
             *      
             * Lightning Cloud - This spawns a formation of clouds covering the entire altitude of where a randomly targeted raid member was located. After 5 seconds,
             *      those clouds will inflict 23750 to 26250(10m)/47500 to 52500(25m) nature damage to nearby players at the same altitude every second. The cloud formation will
             *      despawn after 30 seconds.
